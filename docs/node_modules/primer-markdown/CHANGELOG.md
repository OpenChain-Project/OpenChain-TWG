# v2.5.1
Fixes #59Override background-color on `.emoji` so it doesn't look awkward in zebra striped tables.

# v2.5.0
Add Apple Emoji to default font stackImproves emoji color rendering in Chrome.

# v2.4.0
Make Windows color emoji work in Markdown contentSpecifying Segoe UI Emoji gives us color emoji on Windows 8.1 and newer.Windows 7 and 8 will render monochrome emoji without any extra work onour part, but specifying Segoe UI Symbol gives us slightly better renderingin IE for a few glyphs. This also matches Primer's non-Markdown font stack.

# v2.1.8
Fixin' some links in README and CONTRIBUTINGUpdate README.mdRemove apostropheLooks like the repo changed its name at one point + a copy paste derpfrom twbs/bootstrap.Speaking of which, it might be worth tweaking the “Feature Requests”guidelines in light of GH not really wanting any for Primer :-)

# v2.1.7
Make links in comments underlined on hover in SafariSafari 8 has a bug with the a:not(:link):not(:visited) selector we wereusing previously (see https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142737).Now we use a:not([href]) instead, which should cover all of the cases wecare about (namely, <a name="foo"> elements explicitly created usingHTML syntax in Markdown).

# v2.1.6
Remove link styles on non-link anchors in user contentIt seems to be fairly common for users to write Markdown like thefollowing:    <a name="examples" />    Examples    ========    Here are some examples:This will generate the following HTML:    <p><a name="examples" /></p>    <h2>Examples</h2>    <p>Here are some examples:</p>github.com's current sanitizer (Sanitize 2.0.4) respects self-closingtag syntax (because it is built on top of libxml2, an XML parser, andself-closing tags are an XML thing). So when this gets run throughSanitize 2.0.4, you end up with the following HTML:    <p><a name="examples"></a></p>    <h2>Examples</h2>    <p>Here are some examples:</p>However, both Sanitize 3.x and the new sanitizer we're developing forgithub.com are based on an HTML-compliant parser rather than libxml2.HTML parsers treat this markup differently, and produce the following:    <p><a name="examples"></a></p><a name="examples">    <h2>Examples</h2>    <p>Here are some examples:</p></a>Browsers do the exact same thing given this HTML, as you can see in theLive DOM Viewer[1].Forgetting to close a non-link anchor, or using self-closing tag syntax(which also leaves the tag unclosed) is not normally a problem. Browsersdon't apply any styles to these elements by default, so many web authorsnever even notice they've made this mistake. But github.com applies linkstyles to all anchor elements whether or not they're actually links, sothis mistake becomes very noticeable: suddenly large parts of yourdocument are blue!Changing all of github.com's CSS to only target a:link and a:visitedelements would be a huge change that is probably not worth the effort.Instead, we'll remove the link styles from non-link anchor elements inuser content.[1]: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Ca%20name%3D%22examples%22%20%2F%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Ch2%3EExamples%3C%2Fh2%3E%0A%3Cp%3EHere%20are%20some%20examples%3A%3C%2Fp%3E%0A

In some cases we need to reset the highlightingstyles to match the top-level styles. This makes it so that, e.g., codeinside interpolated strings is colored as code rather than as stringtext. The new <span class="h"> elements that the TextMate highlighterproduces indicate where this needs to happen, and the styles added inthis commit accomplish the reset.See https://github.com/github/lex-luthor/issues/31 andhttps://github.com/github/github/pull/34312 for more discussion.We don't need to distribute this file.
